# Memory Game

One of my first JavaScript project. Here is a simple memory game played by two player who take turns clicking on numbers trying to get matches

Whoever gets the most matches wins. 

## Improvments (writing this as a more experienced developer) 

- A lot

- The css could look much nicer

- There is a lot repeated in the html

- jquery is out, react would be much better

- Add the ability to let the user add add there own photos (I added my own locally when i first made it, and made it look nicer.)

## When time permits

- DO THE ABOVE THINGS
